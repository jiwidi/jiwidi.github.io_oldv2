# Keyboard collection

<!-- So as a computer guy I spend tons of time attached to a keyboard. The keyboard is basically an extension of my while I do any type
of work on the computer. Most common keyboards are nice and do the job, but you can get *pretty overkill* if you want to perfectionize your typing experience. These overkilled keyboards dont have any special functionality and do the same as a plain old keyboard, but they just feel nice to type on and often easier to use for longer periods of time without fatigue on your hands. -->

<!-- This section has all the keyboards I have built. I like to build them myself because im a tinker guy, but you could also just buy them preassembled. The soldering, choosing different parts and putting it all together just brings the engineer inside of me. Then there is the art side of it! When building keyboards people create some really nice design combinations, proof of it would be to visit /r/MechanicalKeyboards/. -->
